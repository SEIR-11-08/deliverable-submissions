At this point we want to copy the repository from our account onto our own computers. 

4. Click on the green button that says code. It should bring up a drop down with the Git URL for the repository on our own account. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the Git URL to your clipboard.

<br/>

5. Open up your terminal application and type `git clone` and then paste in the Git URL you copied from your clipboard.

The command will look something like this.
```bash
git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/msolorio-ga/HW-Loops-Conditionals.git
```
